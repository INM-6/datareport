## miniexample

   Start here. This example might not look very exciting, but it shows you the
   very basics on which all the following examples build. It is also a nice
   playground to come back to later, when you want to try playing with advanced
   concepts in a simple environment.

## Phonelist

   This might be the most frequent use-case: formatting lists or Excel sheets
   into a nicely grouped overview. In this example a data conversion from CSV
   files is added to the workflow and you can explore the `groupby` concept of
   Jinja templates.

## IT-inventory

   A very complex dataset with an example template producing different overview
   tables. Why should difficult things look difficult?

## Juser-authors

   Having all data in a single file quickly becomes quite complex to manage,
   especially when reusing data for different reports. In this example you can
   see how to include data from a web database. Data from different files is
   combined and two reports are generated from the combination.
