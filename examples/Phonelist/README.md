# Phone list example

   This is a simple example for rendering a database of telephone numbers. The
   template automatically sorts and groups the entries, so no extra
   manipulation of the data is necessary.

   Additionally to the rendering of the phone list this example shows how to
   convert CSV data to a more suitable YAML format. Having the fields available
   by name makes the template a lot easier to write and understand. Though, it
   takes some time to get your head around the handling of objects in Jinja2.
