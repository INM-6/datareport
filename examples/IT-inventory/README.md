# IT-inventory Example

   This is the simplest example just using a template and database to produce a
   report. Much of the flexibility that Snakemake and the Reporter offer are
   introduced in other examples. Here you just get the basics and a playground
   to try your ideas!

   The supplied datafile is stripped of any relevant information.
